# Proof-Of-Work
A system made from basic understanding of Proof-of-work system powering cryptocurrencies.

# Requirements:
PyCryptoDome (or Pycrypto - Not recommended) For Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generator for Better(More Even) Probability Distibution of Generated Random Numbers.

### Installation:
```bash
pip install pycryptodome
```

# Usage:
```bash
python3 Miner.py
```
# Lessons:
1. Got to learn and read a lot about proof-of-work and the technologies powering the cryptocurrencies.
2. Found out more about hash functions and data types and structures
3. Saw a great proof that multithreading is very helpful in such use-cases.On a single thread CPU Usage by program was ~ 20%, and with 500 threads (idk how many of them actually started) the CPU usage by code was ~90%.
4. This perfectly Relates Theoretical Mathematical Probability to Real World, So thats kinda awesome.

# Update:
1. Added The OOP Approach, and cleared some more basic features like other Upadte functions (EXponential,Linear,Arbitary)
